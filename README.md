# Card Design with HTML and CSS

This project features a beautifully designed set of cards created using HTML and CSS. Each card includes an image, a summary section, pricing information, and buttons for user interaction.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts well to different screen sizes using `flexbox`.
- **Elegant Styling**: Gradient backgrounds, shadow effects, and rounded corners enhance the aesthetic appeal.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons change color on hover for a modern and engaging user experience.
- **Reusable Components**: Each card is modular and can be reused with minimal modifications.
